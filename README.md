# YOU NEED YOUR MAKE YOUR OWN **CLIENT ID** AND **CLIENT SECRET** FOR THIS TO WORK! 

ight i know you lazy so it only takes 2 minutes...

### Follow these steps.
1. Log into your spotify account at [Spotify Dev Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)
2. Register a new app and get your **client id** and **client secret** (suggesting u dont share this)
3. Set up a redirect URL in the app settings. (http://localhost:8080) > dont worry this is ur own local host
4. Enter your **client id** and **client secret** on **LINE 11 AND 12** of the code


if your not stupid or f up somehow, this should run fine...

problems. 
- redirects you to localhost everytime you click the interface, theres a workaround but im too lazy
- idk might be buggy occasionally
